 My name is Thorpe Daley. I am a senior psychology major, human resource management minor. I am a certified life coach and am really passionate about helping people unlock their potential and be excited about their work and present stage of life. I plan on applying this to a career in business counseling, specializing in common organizational issues such as culture, productivity, and worker satisfaction. Currently, I am working on completing my undergraduate degree and applying for an MBA program.
