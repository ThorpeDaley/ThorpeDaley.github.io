Here are two projects I have presented at conferences in Chattanooga, Tennessee during my time with the HR Science Research Team

![Applicant Reactions to Artificial Intelligence in the Selection Process](https://media.licdn.com/media-proxy/ext?w=800&h=800&f=n&hash=QpJDihI2Qz1yQEbQS%2BR0droaTNM%3D&ora=1%2CaFBCTXdkRmpGL2lvQUFBPQ%2CxAVta5g-0R6jnhodx1Ey9KGTqAGj6E5DQJHUA3L0CHH05IbfPWjvfs-Me7fzpUAWLX1VjQA6Lbu1EmHiF46-edu-dYp13pG3dpL5agYUbhl4lWdI)

-This study is concerned with the applicant reactions to artificial intelligence in the screening process. Previous studies have found that the way an organization uses artificial intelligence to screen their applicants may have positive or negative reactions.  We specifically wanted to look at how people respond to organizations using face-to-face interviews versus artificial intelligence interviews. 

-We hypothesized that applicants who are exposed to face-to-face interviews will have more positive org-attraction, more job pursuit intentions, higher distributive justice perceptions, lower procedural justice perceptions (low invasion of privacy), and thus, will be less likely to sue. Whereas applicants who are exposed to artificial intelligence software interviews will have less positive org-attraction, less job pursuit intentions, lower distributive justice perceptions, higher procedural justice perceptions (low invasion of privacy), and thus, will be more likely to sue.  We further hypothesize that experience with computers and self-efficacy on the interview process will moderate the effect of using artificial intelligence software in the interview process on application perceptions (i.e., increase negative perceptions).

-The results indicated that even individuals with high levels of familiarity with technology had negative reactions to AI. This Suggests that applicants have more favorable reactions to F2F interviews. Overall this Contributes to literature on AI in the selection process.

![Social Media Persona and Hireability: Gender, Marital Status, and Sexual Orientation

-As recruiters and hiring managers increasingly begin to use the social networking sites (SNS) of applicants as a screening to in the hiring process, an ethical and legal debate has risen around viewing applicants’ SNS when making hiring decisions. There is some concern from applicants that the use of this information is an invasion of privacy that could lead to biases in the hiring process. The present study aims to find if these concerns are well-founded by examining the effects of applicants’ displays of gender, sexual orientation, and marital status on SNS on hiring decisions. 

-Previous research has examined the effect of these characteristics in the context of other pre-employment screening procedures (e.g., Nadler & Kufahl, 2014). However, research  has yet to examine the effects of any specific traits on hiring decisions made through SNS screening. The present study aims to fill this gap by looking at how the irrelevant characteristics of gender, marital status, and sexual orientation influence hiring decisions when displayed on SNS. Much of the research on these irrelevant characteristics, even offline, can appear mixed or dependant on circumstance. 

-Collectively, these results suggest that male applicants received higher hireability ratings compared with female applicants, although the effect size was modest .  The results did not suggest that hireability ratings were influenced by sexual orientation or marital status. Further, results did not suggest that gender, marital status, and sexual orientation interacted to influence hireability ratings.
